One of the safety features that has been implemented in the vehicle is a brake failure indicator with a speed limiter. This feature is designed to prevent accidents caused by brake failures, particularly in heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses, where the weight and momentum of the vehicle can cause catastrophic consequences. The brake failure indicator constantly monitors the hydraulic pressure in the brake system and alerts the driver if there is a problem. This can be in the form of a warning light on the dashboard or an audible alarm. If the brake failure indicator is triggered, the speed limiter engages to restrict the vehicleâ€™s maximum speed to a safe level. In the event of a brake failure, this safety feature can reduce the speed of the vehicle to prevent accidents and save lives.
The speed limiter can also be adjusted to different speeds depending on the type of vehicle and the driving conditions. Overall, the brake failure indicator with a speed limiter is an essential safety feature that can prevent accidents and save lives on the road.
